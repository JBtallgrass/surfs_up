# MOD 9 assignment: Surfs Up Challenge
************************************************************************
The following analysis is a follow on assignment for W. Avy- a prospective owner of a Surf and Ice Cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
W. Avy' interest is centered on the opportunities of a year-round shop. Therefore, he is interested in weather information for the year. The project took weather data from a database capturing yearly weather data to determine if the shop could sustain itself throughout the year. The sample set is from June and December.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The following information contains data from observations for June and December. 

### June Statistical analysis
![June descriptional data](https://github.com/JBtallgrass/surfs_up/blob/main/JUN_Desc.png) 

After collecting data for 30 observations, the following data registered for June
The average temperature for Jun is 75 degrees, with a maximum reading of 85 degrees and a low of 64.

# _______________________________________________________________________
### December Statistical analysis

![December descriptional Data](https://github.com/JBtallgrass/surfs_up/blob/main/DEC_Desc.png) 

The data collected from 31 days of observation provided an average temperature for Jun is 71 degrees 
with a maximum reading of 83 degrees and a low of 56.

## The purpose of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the feasibility of operating an ice cream & surf shop on the island of Oahu. The extreme months were selected to provide
a sampling of weather from the traditional months of Summer (June) and Winter (December). 

## Results:
_____________________________________________________________________
The following observations between the months should provide information to support W. Avy's decision:
+ The data sets contained large amounts of observations, requiring automated analysis. 
+ The temperatures do not vary between the months leading to a possible conclusion that the temperatures are constant year-round
+ The temperature variance was more noticeable in December
+ Average temperatures did not vary as much as expected 

### The following images provide supporting data on the variances between the two months.

# Summary:
Supporting analysis provides the illumination of the weather data that might affect the business opportunities on the island of Oahu. Although based o in the observations and the analysis, weather temperature might not provide the expected impact, conclusions surrounding the weather analysis support a year-round endeavor. They consider that a single item, such as the weather, risks the owner. Considerations of tourism, surf conditions, and market analysis of ice cream in Hawaii during December, combined with the weather, would better determine business success.
