# MOD 9 assignment: Surfs Up Challenge
************************************************************************
The following analysis is a follow on assignment for W. Avy- a prospective owner of a Surf and Ice Cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
W. Avy' interest is centered on the opportunities of a year-round shop. Therefore, he is interested in weather information for the year. The project took weather data from a database capturing yearly weather data to determine if the shop could sustain itself throughout the year. The sample set is from June and December.

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The following information contains data from observations for June and December. 

### June Statistical analysis

After collecting data for 30 observations, the following data registered for June
The average temperature for Jun is 75 degrees, with a maximum reading of 85 degrees and a low of 64.

## The purpose of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the feasibility of operating an ice cream & surf shop on the island of Oahu. The extreme months were selected to provide
a sampling of weather from the traditional months of Summer (June) and Winter (December). 

## Results:
The following observations between the months, should provide information to support W. Avy's decision:
+ The data sets contained large amounts of observations, requiring automated analysis. 
+ The temperatures do not vary between the months leading to a possible conclusion that the temperatures are constant year-round
+ The temperature variance was more noticable in December
+ Average temperatures did not vary as much as expected 

The following images provide supporting data of the variances between the two months.
